        <h2>Courses and Programs</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently in the 4th year of the BTM (Business Technology Management) program here at Toronto Metropolitan University.
            I have always been passionate about software development, specifically full-stack development, so I love taking courses around
            coding and technology in general. I enjoyed taking CPS109 because of the way the course was structured. We had to do 100 hands 
            on questions that really allowed us to put into practice what we were learning.
